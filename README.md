# Marvel-Rivals-API-Project
A Streamlit web application that allows users to search Marvel Rivals player profiles and view detailed competitive statistics. Simply enter a playerâ€™s username to view their current rank, ranked win rate, total matches and wins, and a breakdown of their top 5 most played heroes with visual charts.

 Note: This project is still a work in progress. Future plans include integrating web scraping to gather more insights from competitive play and implementing automated email updates.
To use this app, please obtain an API key from marvelrivalsapi.com and replace 'add API key here' with your own key in the code.
